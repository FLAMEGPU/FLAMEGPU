# FLAME GPU Example: MonteCarlo

## Introduction

Monte Carlo simulation is a method of solving deterministic problems by repeated random sampling. The purpose of this example is to show how multi-agent approach can be applied to Monte Carlo crystallization. We present a general method for implementing Monte Carlo simulation in both batch and continuous systems through two case studies (Batch and MSMPR) implemented within the FLAMEGPU simulation framework. The two case studies have been replicated through parallel implementation of GPU. The examples can be found in `examples/MonteCarlo_MSMPR` and `examples/MonteCarlo_BATCH`. We used the base concepts similar to Gooch and Hounslowâ€™s paper [^1].

## How to setup, build, and run MonteCarlo examples on Linux

1\. Install all the needed build tools and libraries. Note that the version of GCC must be suitable for the installed version of CUDA.

```bash
sudo apt-get install g++ git make libxml2-utils xsltproc gnuplot
```

Minimum versions:
- g++: 4.8
- cuda: 7.5

3\. Clone the project using Git (it will be stored in the folder "FLAMEGPU"):  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FLAMEGPU/FLAMEGPU.git
```

Going forward, you will want to pull from the _master_ branch, which will always contain the last known release.

4\. Build the example in Release mode (this is the default mode)

- Batch Simulation
```bash
cd FLAMEGPU/examples/MonteCarlo_BATCH
make all
```
- MSMPR Steady State Simulation
```bash
cd FLAMEGPU/examples/MonteCarlo_MSMPR
make all
```

You can build the Debug version by specifying _debug_ value on the make line instead (`make all debug=1`). Note that the executable is built in Console mode.

5\. To generate charge, simply run the bash script `./generate_charge.sh` in _iterations_ folder. Alternatively, you can manually compile the code and generate the charge for a different number of population.

```bash
cd iterations/
g++ InputGenerator/inpGen.cpp -o inputGen
./inputGen 0.xml input.dat 10000
```

6\. After building the executable and generating charge, run the example. The following command will run a single iteration. 

```bash
cd examples/MonteCarlo_BATCH
../../bin/linux-x64/Release_Console/MonteCarlo_MSMPR iterations/0.xml 1
```


7\. Plotting the histogram results for the simulation and the input charge.

- Batch Simulation
```bash
cd examples/MonteCarlo_BATCH/iterations
gnuplot plot_cs1.plt
```
- MSMPR Steady State Simulation
```bash
cd examples/MonteCarlo_MSMPR/iterations
gnuplot plot_cs2.plt
```

## How to setup, build, and run MonteCarlo examples on Windows

1\. Download and install the windows dependancies for FLAME GPU, and these Montecarlo exmaples

- Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 or later.
- CUDA 8.0 or Later
- git
- gnuplot

3\. Clone the project using Git (it will be stored in the folder "FLAMEGPU"):  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FLAMEGPU/FLAMEGPU.git
```

4\. Open the visual studio solution for the relevant exampl, `MCBatch` or `MC_MSMPR`.

5\. Build both projects within the visual studio solution - both the FLAME GPU model, and `InputGenerator`.

5\. To generate charge using the `InputGenerator`, simply run the script `generate_charge.bat` (or `generate_charge.sh` using bash) in `iterations` folder.

6\. After building the executable and generating charge, run the example. The following command will run a single iteration. 


```batch
cd examples\MonteCarlo_BATCH
..\..\bin\x64\Release_Console\MonteCarlo_MSMPR iterations\0.xml 1
```

or

```bash
cd examples/MonteCarlo_BATCH
../../bin/x64/Release_Console/MonteCarlo_MSMPR iterations/0.xml 1
```


7\. Plotting the histogram results for the simulation and the input charge.

- Batch Simulation
```bash
cd examples/MonteCarlo_BATCH/iterations
gnuplot plot_cs1.plt
```
- MSMPR Steady State Simulation
```bash
cd examples/MonteCarlo_MSMPR/iterations
gnuplot plot_cs2.plt
```
