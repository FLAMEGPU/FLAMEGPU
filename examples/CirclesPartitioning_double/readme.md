# FLAME GPU Example: CirclesPartitioning_double

A GPU accelerated implementation of the Circles model, using spatially partitioned messaging and double precision floating point values.

It consists of a number of points which exert a repulsive and potentially attractive force over a limited range 2r2r. Over a number of iterations the model will exhibit a force resolution which will ultimately result in a stable state. The model has origins in a number of biological systems and is analogous to that of cellular interactions of simple swarm systems.
