The social particle swarm (sps) model is a particles-based simulation of social agents inspired from self-driven particle systems. Agents interacts in a 3D Cartesian space which is an abstraction of the social or psychological space. Interaction occurs mainly through kinematics (attraction or repulsion). Each particle has an interaction range

 within an iterated prisoners dilemma game. There are two types of particles in the population: Cooperators (in blue) and defectors (in red), each particle seeks to maximize the total payoff it receives from its neighbors, and it gets closer to those who offer benefit, and pulls away from those who don't.
