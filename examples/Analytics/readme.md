# FLAME GPU Example: Analytics

This is a technical example, showcasing the use of the FLAME GPU analytics functions added in FLAME GPU 1.5, via the use of STEP functions.

It is based on the `circles` example model, with an additional step function and exit function, which output the result of reductions across the entire agent population.
Please see src/model/functions.c or the FLAME GPU documentation for details of reduction functions.
