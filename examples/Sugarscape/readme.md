# FLAME GPU Example: Sugarscape

A GPU accelerated implementation of the Sugarscape model, an enhaced version of Conway's Game of Life.

A 2D Cellular Automata, where each cell contains a quantity of a resource (sugar). 
Each agent assesses their local neighbourhood, and performs appropriate actions.
