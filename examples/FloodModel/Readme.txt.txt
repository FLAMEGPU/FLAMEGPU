Done by the date: 

- 0.XML generator has been coded by MS to generate 'Three Humps' model(test case) initial condition based on mesh-grid model (Matlab/C code)
	* This code is accessible through 0XMLgenerator folder - number of agents can be changed by decreasing the mesh size.
	* The content is then copied and pasted to ~/itterations/0.xml

- Function.c and XMLModelFile are coded and specified based on the case study model (Three Humps - flood modeling)
	* Finite Volume (FV) method has been used to solve Shallow Water Equation (SWE) in this Flood modelling.
