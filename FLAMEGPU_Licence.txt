PERMITTED MODIFICATION AND USE The source code of the Software is provided to (a) promote experimentation and development of new features to the core code which might eventually be incorporated into the official version; and b)  provide insight into the inner workings of the program for educational purposes. Except as expressly set out in this agreement, or permitted by another agreement between you and UoS, any use or modification of the source code is expressly prohibited. GOOD Subject to this Section 11.3 and the balance of this Section 11, 
You are granted the privilege to modify the behaviour of the Licensed Version for your own personal use if such modification fulfils one or more purposes set out in Section 
11.1. Each output of such a modification or compilation is called a "Modified Version" in these terms and conditions. Modifications must be implemented either (a) as discrete source code patch files that are compiled alongside the source code of the Licensed Version to create the Modified Version of the Software, or (b) as compiled software components or objects that can be installed alongside the Licensed Version to deliver the functionality of the Modified Version. 
Nothing in these terms and conditions gives You any rights or permissions to use, reproduce or modify any part of the source code for any version of the Software other than in a Modified Version of the Software. In particular all Modified Versions that you create must, in substance, be discrete software programmes that implement modifications of the Licensed Version. You may use any Modified Version that you alone have created only under the terms herein granted for the Licensed Version from which the Modified Version was created. Nothing in these terms permits any other person to use any Modified Version. 

12. MODIFIED VERSIONS Strict conditions and restrictions are imposed if you wish to distribute a Modified Version of the Software, its documentation or other parts of the package, including any translation of the documentation into other languages or file formats. You may only distribute the source code patch files or compiled software components or objects described in section 11.3 above. You must accompany each object code version of the Modified Version which is distributed with the full source code for that Modified Version and full documentation describing all modifications that you have made to the Licensed Version, or you must make available for download over the internet to each person who receives an object code version of the Modified Version the full source code for the Modified Version and full documentation describing all modifications that You have made to the Licensed Version. You must make each person who receives the Modified Version aware that the source code and documentation for the Licensed Version is available for download, and the location from which it can be downloaded. A Modified Version must have all of the functions of the Licensed Version with all existing features, copyright notices, author attributions, all Licences, etc., intact. You must require users of any Modified Version to observe the same restrictions in respect of the Modified Version that this Licence requires of users of the Licensed Version, including without limitation Section 11.1 of this Licence. You must clearly state that a Modified Version is a Modified Version and not a Licensed Version. You must clearly state that the Modified Version is an unofficial version. You must identify the creator of the Modified Version. You must ensure that each user of the Modified Version is aware that it is an unofficial build of the Software which is not supported by UoS and that UoS is not in any way responsible for it. You acknowledge that UoS has ownership of the Modified Version in the context of Section 2.1 of this Licence. You must send a copy of the Modified Version to UoS. GOOD You accept that UoS may use this Modified Version as it wishes, whether commercially or otherwise.

13. CONTRIBUTING BUG FIXES AND ENHANCEMENTS Whilst UoS encourages submissions and patches, it is not obliged to accept enhancements and bug fixes that you submit to it. However, if it does so, it will do so without payment or other consideration to you unless agreed otherwise in writing. UoS may require you to complete and send documentation to UoS prior to accepting a bug fix and, in particular, will require a copyright assignment of each contribution.

14. MISCELLANEOUS UoS may modify this agreement at any time by making a revised Licence available from (www.flamegpu.com).
